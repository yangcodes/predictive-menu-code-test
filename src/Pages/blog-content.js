      `If a new customer entered your store and was keen on buying something, you would never dream of ignoring them.`,
      `Even if they’re just browsing, you would not let them leave without trying to make a good impression on them. You’d try and win them over for next time they are looking to buy. You’d respect and thank them for thinking about you, and share knowledge with them about products you have, so that they leave better informed consumers. Maybe they’ll remember you the next time they have a purchase to make.`,
      `You need to treat your candidates as you do your customers. You need to treat them with respect, give them an interview experience that makes them feel comfortable, familiar and convenient, is fast, and dignifies the effort they have made in applying. Go further and give them feedback and insights about their strengths and weaknesses that they can use when looking at other jobs, it’s likely they will think of you in the future, and recommend you to their friends.`,
      `As Michael Eizenberg, Head of Qantas Group Talent, Digital & Analytics told us: “We care deeply about two things when it comes to hiring. Firstly, diversity and inclusivity, and secondly the experience of everyone who comes into contact with the Qantas brand. Our goal is to treat every candidate like we would a customer.”`,
      `Organisations need to not only consciously articulate and promote the value they offer and why people should consider working for them – they actually have to prove it through their recruitment process. `,

    title: "How Iceland won best in-house innovation in recruitment",
    content: [
      `Established in 2002, the Recruiter Awards gala is the UK’s largest event for the entire recruitment community recognising outstanding achievements by agencies and in-house recruiters.`,
      `The award recognises the partnership between  Iceland and PredictiveHire that saved their store leaders 24,000 hours a year by implementing transformational change – during a pandemic.`,
      `The Judges comments were that: “ this simple, straightforward submission ticked every box by demonstrating the contribution the recruitment function played to the success of their overall business. They also clearly demonstrated thoughtful consideration to the fact that many candidates would be applying for jobs at Iceland following the decimation of their previous career paths, for example, aviation industry employees.”`,
      `We’re thrilled to announce that along with our customer Iceland Foods, we won the award for Best In-House Innovation in Recruitment at the 2021 Recruiter Awards in London.`,

    title: "Five steps you can take to help data build better DE&I outcomes",
    content: [
      `Creating an organisation that is inclusive, hires and promotes everyone equitably and has a diverse representation of people requires confronting uncomfortable truths and the confidence to navigate these with heart. The path to meaningful change cannot be done without data. Data allows us to clearly diagnose issues in a company, and also, just as importantly, to measure what is working. Without data-backed accountability,  it’s unlikely much will change.`,
      `The good news is that these days most organisations believe that diverse teams are beneficial to business outcomes, innovation, customer loyalty and employee trust. The better your team represents its customers, the few blind spots you’ll have when it comes to meeting customer needs.`,
      `The biggest challenge is not often not around intention, but rather diagnosing what is happening inside an organisation. The reasons contributing to bias are often numerous and complex like company history, systemic racism and sexism, leaving decisions to ‘gut feelings’ and well-intentioned directives to hire based on “culture fit” that only result in more homogenous teams.`,
      `This is being accountable. Measure where you are at, learn from it, and set on improving on where you are. Then do it again. This is where the power of data really lies – by trying initiatives and testing what is working, and then measuring the outcomes – you can iterate quickly when no headway is being made. This takes all the guesswork out of whether there is improvement or not.

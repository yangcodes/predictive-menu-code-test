    <h1>Welcome to the PredictiveHire Summit 2021</h1>
    <p>
      PredictiveHire has won Best Innovation in Algorithmic Bias Mitigation for
      Fair AI in Recruitment (FAIR™). CogX is the world’s largest celebration of
      Ai and emerging technology. This is the second time we have been honoured
      at these awards shortlisted last year for Best Conversational Ai Solution
      for HR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big question of this year’s CogX awards “How do we get the next 10
      years right?” couldn’t be more important to us. We want to give everyone a
      fair go when it comes to getting a job. It has the potential to have so
      much impact in addressing bias and structural inequality in the world. We
      know because we’ve seen it. We’ve helped some of the world’s most trusted
      consumer brands achieve their DE&I metrics by giving all applicants a fair
      go.

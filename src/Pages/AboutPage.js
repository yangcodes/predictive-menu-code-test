    <h1>About PredictiveHire</h1>
    <p>
      We believe that our platform is the world’s most inclusive talent solution
      and we’re proud to be leading the way on the ethical use of Ai for hiring.
      We want to empower leaders considering Ai for hiring by giving them the
      right questions to ask vendors, and we want to get developers talking
      about bias mitigation best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year we made FAIR™, our framework for the ethical use of Ai in
      hiring, available on the public domain. Our framework presents a set of
      measures and guidelines to implement and maintain fairness in Ai-based
      candidate selection tools. It is a data-driven approach to fairness. It
      was a bold move, but CogX liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAIR™ was created by our team of incredibly dedicated data scientists, led
      by the incredibly humble Buddhi Jayatilleke our Chief Data Scientist. Our
      team have tested and re-tested and experimented and re-experimented to
      find a new formula for assessing talent–one that is 100% inclusive and
      bias-free.

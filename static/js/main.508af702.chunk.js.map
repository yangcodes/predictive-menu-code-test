You’d try and win them over for next time they are looking to buy. You’d respect and thank them for thinking about you, and share knowledge with them about products you have, so that they leave better informed consumers. Maybe they’ll remember you the next time they have a purchase to make.`,\n      `You need to treat your candidates as you do your customers. You need to treat them with respect, give them an interview experience that makes them feel comfortable, familiar and convenient, is fast, and dignifies the effort they have made in applying. Go further and give them feedback and insights about their strengths and weaknesses that they can use when looking at other jobs, it’s likely they will think of you in the future, and recommend you to their friends.`,\n      `As Michael Eizenberg, Head of Qantas Group Talent, Digital & Analytics told us: “We care deeply about two things when it comes to hiring. Firstly, diversity and inclusivity, and secondly the experience of everyone who comes into contact with the Qantas brand.

The path to meaningful change cannot be done without data. Data allows us to clearly diagnose issues in a company, and also, just as importantly, to measure what is working. Without data-backed accountability,  it’s unlikely much will change.`,\n      `The good news is that these days most organisations believe that diverse teams are beneficial to business outcomes, innovation, customer loyalty and employee trust. The better your team represents its customers, the few blind spots you’ll have when it comes to meeting customer needs.`,\n      `The biggest challenge is not often not around intention, but rather diagnosing what is happening inside an organisation. The reasons contributing to bias are often numerous and complex like company history, systemic racism and sexism, leaving decisions to ‘gut feelings’ and well-intentioned directives to hire based on “culture fit” that only result in more homogenous teams.`,\n      `This is being accountable. Measure where you are at, learn from it, and set on improving on where you are. Then do it again. This is where the power of data really lies – by trying initiatives and testing what is working, and then measuring the outcomes – you can iterate quickly when no headway is being made.
